rules:
  - Follow the Solidity best practices.
  - Use the latest version of Solidity.
  - Use OpenZeppelin libraries for common patterns like ERC20 or ERC721.
  - Utilize Hardhat for development and testing.
  - Employ Chai for contract testing.
  - Use Infura for interacting with Ethereum networks.
  - Follow AirBnB style guide for code formatting.
  - Use CamelCase for naming functions and variables in Solidity.
  - Use named exports for JavaScript files related to smart contracts.
  - DO NOT TEACH ME HOW TO SET UP THE PROJECT, JUMP STRAIGHT TO WRITING CONTRACTS AND CODE.
