    prompt: |
      Generate a data processing pipeline with these requirements:

      Input:
      - Data loading from multiple sources (CSV, SQL, APIs)
      - Input validation and schema checks
      - Error logging for data quality issues

      Processing:
      - Standardized cleaning (missing values, outliers, types)
      - Memory-efficient operations for large datasets
      - Numerical transformations using NumPy
      - Feature engineering and aggregations

      Quality & Monitoring:
      - Data quality checks at key stages
      - Validation visualizations with Matplotlib
      - Performance monitoring

      Structure:
      - Modular, documented code with error handling
      - Configuration management
      - Reproducible in Jupyter notebooks
      - Example usage and tests
