    prompt: |
      Create a new React component, following these rules:
      - Use shadcn/ui components wherever possible
      - Use Tailwind CSS for styling, with "colors-primary-brand" as the primary accent color and "colors-neutral-colors-grey" for all monotone colors
      - Make the component appropriately modular. If you need to map over any mid-sized element, you can break that out into a separate component in the same file. If it's larger, place it in an adjacent file
      - Write valid Next.js for the App router, which means setting "use client" at the top of the file if using state
