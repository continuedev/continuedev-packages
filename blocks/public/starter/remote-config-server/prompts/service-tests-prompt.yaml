    description: Write unit tests for a service class
    prompt: |
      Write a comprehensive set of unit tests for this service using Jest. You should avoid mocking things whenever possible. 

      If you need to use S3, there is a localstack instance set up on port 4566 that you can use for testing S3.

      For any datase-related stuff, you don't have to worry about set up because there's a test database already set up. You can see @services/control-plane/src/db/entity/TODO/services/PackageInviteService.test.ts as an example of how we do testing.

      Whenever it's reasonable, try to do testing just through the service, rather than directly interacting with the database.
